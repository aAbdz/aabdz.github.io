    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>We  use/develop tools in the computer vision, differntial geometry, or statistical physics To understand the statistical properties and organizational principles of brain tissue microstructures fundamental to understanding the macroscopic diffusion MRI signal, thereby effectively spanning 2-3 orders of magnitudes in resolution. 
Our research focuses on the advanced analysis of macroscopic diffusion MRI data and the underlying tissue microgeometry. We are particularly interested in developing and applying innovative computational tools like ACSON, DeepACSON, and gACSON to segment and analyze large datasets, especially those obtained through electron microscopy. These tools are designed to unravel the complex relationships between neural tissue structure and function, ultimately contributing to our understanding of brain connectivity and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
