    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>Our research focuses on uncovering the statistical properties and organizational principles of brain tissue microstructures, primarily acquired using large-scale electron microscopy, that are fundamental to understanding their macroscopic diffusion MR signals.
    By identifying these properties, we aim to discover quantitative markers that can facilitate the early diagnosis of neurological disorders.</p>

    <p>Our approach involves both theoretical advancements and the design and development of computational tools to model and analyze these microstructures.</p>

    <h4>Key questions guiding our work:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the underlying rules governing the organization of tissue microstructure?</li>
        <li>Which structural properties of brain tissue are conserved and contribute to the diffusion signal?</li>
        <li>How do neurological disorders alter the microgeometry of brain tissue?</li>
    </ul>
